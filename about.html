                <h2>About the Aqua Outback Experience</h2>
                <p>Sometimes, caught up in our day to day lives, we forget that we are also a part of the tapestry of Nature. 
                    <br>
                    There are times when we all need to let go of our routines and take the time to realise our true connection with nature. To watch the tides change, hear the wind rise over the salt flats. To watch the flamingos fly low on the horizon. To look up into the unblemished canopy of the stars and watch the moon rise. To listen to the sounds of the ocean meeting the shores. To watch Barracuda, Barramundi and Grouper dart through the reefs in a feeding frenzy. To watch the patterns of your feet mark glowing lines across the sea with bio-luminescent algae as you walk by.
                    <br>
                    There are a multitude of things to do at Aqua Outback while living in the lap of Nature.
                    <br>
                    We Aqua Outback would like to provide you with the opportunity to find yourself with nature. Come, explore the wilderness. Re-think your role in the cycle of nature and understand your connection with the greater whole. And, hopefully, return, rejuvenated, to re-live your life as a part of that greater whole.</p>
